# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualization

This project is an interactive web-based visualization tool for advanced data structures and algorithms, focusing on Log-Structured Merge Trees (LSM Trees), Bloom Filters, Skip Lists, and related concepts.

## Features

- **LSM Tree Visualization**: Interactive demonstration of LSM Tree operations including compaction and SSTable management
- **Bloom Filter Implementation**: Visual representation of Bloom Filter's probabilistic data structure
- **Skip List Navigation**: Step-by-step visualization of Skip List operations
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time analysis of algorithmic complexity and performance
- **Query Tracing**: Visual tracking of query execution paths
- **Storage Inspector**: Real-time inspection of data structure storage states
- **Interactive Terminal**: Command-line interface for direct interaction with data structures

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser (No Installation Required)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
3. Start experimenting with the data structures!

### Option 2: Use Local Web Server (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies (optional, for development tools)
npm install

# Start local server
npm start

# Or use any other web server, e.g.:
python -m http.server 8080
# Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```
